# project_agro

This is a software project done by us, second year undergraduates introducing a web application designed to connect small farmers engaged in home gardening with fertilizer sellers. The platform allows farmers to search and access a variety of fertilizers suited for their specific gardening needs. On the other hand, sellers can showcase their products and interact directly with farmers to provide personalized recommendations and support.
